 

Sendmail has a vulnerabilty in the crackaddr function which is in headers.c. 
We can crash the sendmail's child process by sending a mail which has more than 138 <> (angular braces). 
The strings after 138 <> is being overwritten in the MciCache pointer. So, it gets crashed. 

We have attached a text file of the mail that crashed the sendmail locally. 
Using our code, we could crash the sendmail, change the password of the target machine and could also reboot the machine. 
We have to specify the IP address of the target system. We are attaching three different codes. 

Crashing code.c : crashes the sendmail

Remote_rebooting.c : reboots the other system

password_attack.c : changes the password of the other system
